If the following code is legal what can we infer about the return type of f?

double d = f()[n];

By the array access '[n]' we know the return value is a container, though not what type. It could
be a fixed or dynamic (vector) array (from the perspective of what has been covered in the book).
We also know the container holds values implicitly convertable to double. If the value is larger
than a double, data loss may occur.
