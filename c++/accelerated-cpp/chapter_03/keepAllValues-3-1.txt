Not a rigorous proof:

median (x) is defined by the middle of an ordered set of numbers.

Any attempt to track a subset of the set of values (n) only requires that the
unknown, to-be-added values all exist on one side (higher or lower) than the 
current median's index (i) such that:

newValuesHigher > newValuesLower + x - i + 1 (with higher and lower being interchangable)

Assumes the case of a symmetrically tracked subset and the new values differing
from the original.
